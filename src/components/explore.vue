          <h4 id="list-item-1">Business Analyst</h4>
          <div align='left'>
            A business analyst (BA) is someone who analyzes an organization or business domain (real or hypothetical) and
            documents its business or processes or systems, assessing the business model or its integration with technology.
            There are at least four types of business analysis:</br></br>
            1. Business developer – to identify the organization's business needs and business' opportunities</br>
            2. Business model analysis – to define the organization's policies and market approaches</br>
            3. Process design – to standardize the organization’s workflows</br>
            4. Systems analysis – the interpretation of business rules and requirements for technical systems (generally within IT)</br></br>
            The business analyst, sometimes, is someone who is a part of the business operation and works with Information Technology to improve the quality of the services being delivered, sometimes assisting in Integration and Testing of new solutions. Business Analysts act as a liaison between management and technical developers.

          <h4 id="list-item-2">Data Analyst</h4>
          <div align = 'left'>
            Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, while being used in different business, science, and social science domains. </br></br>
            Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.
            Data integration is a precursor to data analysis,[according to whom?] and data analysis is closely linked[how?] to data visualization and data dissemination. The term data analysis is sometimes used as a synonym for data modeling.

          <h4 id="list-item-3">Data Scientist</h4>
          <div align='left'>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.
            Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science.
            </br></br>A data scientist is someone who makes value out of data. Such a person proactively fetches information from various sources and analyzes it for better understanding about how the business performs, and to build AI tools that automate certain processes within the company.
            </br></br>There are many definitions of this job, and it is sometimes mixed with the Big Data engineer occupation. A data scientist or engineer may be X% scientist, Y% software engineer, and Z% hacker, which is why the definition of the job becomes convulted. The actual ratios vary depending on the skills required and type of job. Usually, it’s considered normal to bring people with different sets of skills into the data science team.
            </br></br>Data scientist duties typically include creating various machine learning-based tools or processes within the company, such as recommendation engines or automated lead scoring systems. People within this role should also be able to perform statistical analysis.

          <h4 id="list-item-4">Human Resource</h4>
          <div align='left'>William R. Tracey, in "The Human Resources Glossary," defines Human Resources as: "The people that staff and operate an organization," as contrasted with the financial and material resources of an organization. A human resource is a single person or employee within your organization. Human resources refer to all of the people you employ. </br></br>
            Human Resources is also the organizational function that deals with the people and issues related to people such as compensation and benefits, recruiting and hiring employees, onboarding employees, performance management, training, organization development and culture, and advising senior staff about the impact on people of their financial, planning, and performance decisions on the people in the organization.

          <h4 id="list-item-5">Management Consulting Analyst</h4>
          <div align='left'>Management consulting is the practice of helping organizations to improve their performance, operating primarily through the analysis of existing organizational problems and the development of plans for improvement. Organizations may draw upon the services of management consultants for a number of reasons, including gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and access to the consultants' specialized expertise.
            </br></br>
            As a result of their exposure to, and relationships with numerous organizations, consulting firms are typically aware of industry "best practices." However, the specific nature of situations under consideration may limit the ability to transfer such practices from one organization to another.
            </br></br>
            Consultancies may also provide organizational change management assistance, development of coaching skills, process analysis, technology implementation, strategy development, or operational improvement services. Management consultants often bring their own proprietary methodologies or frameworks to guide the identification of problems, and to serve as the basis for recommendations for more effective or efficient ways of performing work tasks.

            <div align='left'>
              Operations management is an area of management concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. It involves the responsibility of ensuring that business operations are efficient in terms of using as few resources as needed and effective in terms of meeting customer requirements. It is concerned with managing an entire production system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services), as an asset or delivers a product or services. Operations produce products, manage quality and creates service. Operation management covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology. Operations is one of the major functions in an organization along with supply chains, marketing, finance and human resources. The operations function requires management of both the strategic and day-to-day production of goods and services
            </br></br>
            In managing manufacturing or service operations several types of decisions are made including operations strategy, product design, process design, quality management, capacity, facilities planning, production planning and inventory control. Each of these requires an ability to analyze the current situation and find better solutions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of manufacturing or service operations
