          <h4 id="list-item-1">Business Analyst</h4>
          <div align='left'>
            A business analyst (BA) is someone who analyzes an organization or business domain (real or hypothetical) and
            documents its business or processes or systems, assessing the business model or its integration with technology.
            There are at least four types of business analysis:</br></br>
            1. Business developer – to identify the organization's business needs and business' opportunities</br>
            2. Business model analysis – to define the organization's policies and market approaches</br>
            3. Process design – to standardize the organization’s workflows</br>
            4. Systems analysis – the interpretation of business rules and requirements for technical systems (generally within IT)</br></br>
            The business analyst, sometimes, is someone who is a part of the business operation and works with Information Technology to improve the quality of the services being delivered, sometimes assisting in Integration and Testing of new solutions. Business Analysts act as a liaison between management and technical developers.

           <h4 id="list-item-2">Data Analyst</h4>
           <div align = 'left'>
              Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, while being used in different business, science, and social science domains. </br></br>
              Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.
              Data integration is a precursor to data analysis,[according to whom?] and data analysis is closely linked[how?] to data visualization and data dissemination. The term data analysis is sometimes used as a synonym for data modeling.

           <h4 id="list-item-3">Data Scientist</h4>
           <div align='left'>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.
              Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science.
              </br></br>A data scientist is someone who makes value out of data. Such a person proactively fetches information from various sources and analyzes it for better understanding about how the business performs, and to build AI tools that automate certain processes within the company.
              </br></br>There are many definitions of this job, and it is sometimes mixed with the Big Data engineer occupation. A data scientist or engineer may be X% scientist, Y% software engineer, and Z% hacker, which is why the definition of the job becomes convulted. The actual ratios vary depending on the skills required and type of job. Usually, it’s considered normal to bring people with different sets of skills into the data science team.
              </br></br>Data scientist duties typically include creating various machine learning-based tools or processes within the company, such as recommendation engines or automated lead scoring systems. People within this role should also be able to perform statistical analysis.

           <h4 id="list-item-4">Human Resource</h4>
           <div align='left'>William R. Tracey, in "The Human Resources Glossary," defines Human Resources as: "The people that staff and operate an organization," as contrasted with the financial and material resources of an organization. A human resource is a single person or employee within your organization. Human resources refer to all of the people you employ. </br></br>
             Human Resources is also the organizational function that deals with the people and issues related to people such as compensation and benefits, recruiting and hiring employees, onboarding employees, performance management, training, organization development and culture, and advising senior staff about the impact on people of their financial, planning, and performance decisions on the people in the organization.

           <div align='left'>Management consulting analysts, often called management consultants, propose ways to improve an organization's efficiency. They advise managers on how to make organizations more profitable through reduced costs and increased revenues. </br></br>
          Although some management analysts work for the organization that they are analyzing, most work as consultants on a contractual basis. Whether they are self-employed or part of a large consulting company, the work of a management analyst may vary from project to project. Some projects require a team of consultants, each specializing in one area. In other projects, consultants work independently with the client organization's managers.
          Management analysts often specialize in certain areas, such as inventory management or reorganizing corporate structures to eliminate duplicate and nonessential jobs. Some consultants specialize in a specific industry, such as healthcare or telecommunications. In government, management analysts usually specialize by type of agency.
          Organizations hire consultants to develop strategies for entering and remaining competitive in the electronic marketplace.<br><br>

           <h4 id="list-item-6">Operations Analyst</h4>
           <div align='left'>Operations Analysts identify the defects in business models and operations. They conduct research, investigate workflows, business procedures, and recommend changes. These analysts work to ensure that companies are following compliance standards and regulations. Analysts work to improve a company’s productivity and revenue making procedures.Operations analysts conduct internal audits. They coordinate with every department, meet with managers, and assess their work processes. Where there are deficiencies, they suggest changes and prepare reports for executive and operations managers. Analysts are mathematically inclined, as they have to develop, generate, and review statistics, graphs, and numeric data.
           An operations analyst's responsibilities include providing data assessments and measuring performance to support a particular strategy or direction the company is taking or wants to take. For example, a sales team operations analyst supports a sales department by providing reports, graphs and other analysis on monthly sales figures. The data provided indicate goals met, goals missed and areas needing improvement. The analyst may also perform competitive research, track trends, be required to manage databases, integrate multiple sources of data, and prepare business reviews and presentations.</br></br>

           <h4 id="list-item-7">Software Engineer</h4>
           <div align='left'>Every business that generates its own computer programs or needs to personalize third-party software needs software engineers to write, edit and test programs. There are many layers of computer software, and each requires a specialist in languages specific to that layer. Software engineering is a rapidly changing field: training in software is available at nearly all learning institutions, and most software engineers continue to learn on the job, as languages and development environments evolve.
            Software engineers tend to specialize in a few areas of development, such as networks, operating systems, databases or applications, and each area requires fluency in its own set of computer languages and development environments. A small percentage of software engineers work alone, but most collaborate with other specialists in development groups all working together to create complex projects.</br></br>
